        <p>I'm an aspiring programmer. After having spent two years as a teacher, I'm looking to make a career change! I'm working hard in the Brightpaths program so that if all goes well, I can be an employed software developer by the end of this year.</p>
        <p>I have already taken one bootcamp last summer. This was extremely significant for my professional journey, in that it gave me familiarity in the tools and skills I will need both for this program and for actually working in the industry.</p>

        <p>I am an avid sports fan, particularly of the St. Louis Cardinals, the Green Bay Packers, and the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I love to read. I have a particular love for fantasy and SciFi literature, but I also read plenty of nonfiction (mostly about history).</p>
        <p>Lastly, I'm a gamer through and through! I love video games, and one day I would really love to make one of my own. In my spare time, I am learning a bit of C# and the Unity game engine in hopes that one day I'll be able to design a complete game, either by myself or with a team of friends.</p>
